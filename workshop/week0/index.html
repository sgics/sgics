    <h2>
        Assignment 0: Make something cool
    </h2>

    <p>
        It's time to choose your own adventure! Your assignment, quite simply, is to implement in Scratch, at
        scratch.mit.edu, any project of your choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else,
        subject only to the following requirements:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
        </li>
        <li>
            Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must
            take at least one input.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though
            instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than <a
                href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277537196">Oscartime</a> and <a
                href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326129433">Ivy's Hardest Game</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        To meet these requirements, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall. And your
        code should ideally be not only correct but also well-designed. If one of your scripts is getting a bit
        long, try to break it up into multiple scripts (each of which does something specific). And try to leverage
        “abstraction” where possible: if you can imagine giving a descriptive name to a sequence of blocks (e.g.,
        meow), those could probably be moved to a custom block
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want some inspiration from Harvard's CS50 Students, here are some of those:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/37412/">It's Raining Men</a>, from lecture
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/37413/">Soccer</a>, a game
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26329196/">Cookie Love Story</a>, an animation
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277536784/">Gingerbread tales</a>, an interactive story.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/75390754/">Intersection</a>, a game
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/422258685">Hogwarts</a>, a game
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        You might find these
        <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all">tutorials</a>
        or
        <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/starter-projects">starter projects</a> helpful. And you're welcome to explore
        <a href="scratch.mit.edu">scratch.mit.edu</a> for
        inspiration. But try to think of an idea on your own, and then set out to implement it. However, don't try to
        implement the entirety of your project all at once: tackle one piece at a time, just as we did in lecture. In
        other words, take baby steps: write a bit of code (i.e., drag and drop a few puzzle pieces), test, write a bit
        more, test, and so forth. And select <strong>File > Save</strong> now every few minutes so that you don't lose
        any work!
    </p>

    <p>
        If, along the way, you find it too difficult to implement some feature, try not to fret; alter your design or
        work around the problem. If you set out to implement an idea that you find fun, odds are you won't find it too
        hard to satisfy the above requirements.
    </p>

    <p>Alright, off you go. Make us proud!</p>

    <p>
        Once finished with your project, select <strong>>File > Save</strong> now one last time. Then select
        <strong>File > Save to your computer</strong> and keep that file so that you can submit it.
